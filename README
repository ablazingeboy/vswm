vswm - very stupid window manager
=================================

Probably the most stupid window manager every created, written over an ancient
relic of a library called Xlib -- a library so old that it preceeded the birth
of planet Earth itself.

- All windows are fullscreen.
- Windows can not be moved or resized.
- There are no workspaces.
