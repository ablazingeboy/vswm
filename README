vswm - very stupid window manager
=================================

Probably the most stupid window manager ever created, written over an ancient
relic of a library called Xlib -- a library so old that it preceeded the birth
of planet Earth itself.

- There are no workspaces.
- All windows are maximised.
- Windows can not be moved or resized.
- Only one window is visible at a time.
- This certainly isn't for everyone.


Keybindings
-----------

MOD4 + Tab               focus next window
MOD4 + Shift + Tab       focus prev window
MOD4 + Shift + q         kill window
MOD4 + Shift + r         refresh wm [*]

MOD4 + b                 chromium
MOD4 + Return            xterm
MOD4 + d                 dmn
