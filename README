vswm - very stupid window manager
=================================

Probably the most stupid window manager ever created, written over an ancient
relic of a library called Xlib -- a library so old that it preceeded the birth
of planet Earth itself.

- There are no workspaces.
- All windows are maximised.
- Windows can not be moved or resized.
- Only one window can be visible at a time.
- This is similar to jumping between TTYs.
- This certainly isn't for everyone.
